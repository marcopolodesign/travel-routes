# Fonts

Copy the **Thunder** font files here for heading typography:

- `Thunder-BoldLC.woff2`
- `Thunder-BoldLC.woff`

They are referenced in the pokemon-tcg-shop project at `Local/pokemon-tcg-shop/public/fonts/`. If you have that project, copy the two files into this folder. The app will fall back to system fonts if the files are missing.
